# API Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is an API, and how does it work?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It works by sending requests from a client to a server and receiving responses, often in formats like JSON or XML.

## 2. What are client secret keys and authentication keys, and how are they used in APIs?
- **Client Secret Key**: A confidential key used in OAuth authentication to verify the identity of an application.
- **Authentication Key**: A unique key (such as an API key or token) used to validate API requests and grant access to resources securely.

## 3. What are HTTP methods, and how are they used in API requests?
HTTP methods define the type of operation performed in an API request:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Send new data to the server.
- **PUT**: Update existing data.
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the server.

## 4. What is the purpose of API authentication, and what are common authentication methods?
API authentication ensures that only authorized users can access resources. Common methods include:
- **API Keys**: A unique identifier sent with requests.
- **OAuth**: A token-based authentication method.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A secure way to transmit authentication data.
- **Basic Authentication**: Username and password-based authentication.

## 5. What is an API key, and how is it used?
An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate API requests. It is sent as a parameter in the request header or URL to verify the user's access rights.
